# Wayang kulit
Wayang kulit is a form of traditional theatre in Southeast Asia. It involves a puppet shadow play performance with origins that are possibly linked to the Indian shadow play. There are many forms and types of wayang kulit in Asia. Those performed in Peninsular Malaysia have either Javanese or Patani (southern Thai) influences. Wayang kulit performances are usually accompanied by a gamelan (an Indonesian musical ensemble).

## Definition
The term wayang kulit literally means “shadows from hide”, and has a few meanings in the Southeast Asian context. In Indonesia, the term wayang kulit refers not only to the performance of a shadow play, but has also become synonymous with the hide puppets used to create the shadows. In Peninsular Malaysia, wayang kulit can be translated as a “show of skins”.

## The puppets
The puppets in wayang kulit come in many sizes, depending on the characters they portray. Malay shadow play puppets typically measure at least 71 cm long and are at most 30.5 cm wide. A complete shadow theatre has between 160 and 200 puppets categorised into deities, warriors, ogres, hermits, monkeys, soldiers, princesses, weapons, animals and mountains. Most Malay shadow play characters only have one articulating limb, while a majority of Javanese and Balinese puppets have both arms articulated. The puppets are carved out of cowhide in ornate designs, and then beautifully painted with bright colours. Female cowhide is preferred as it is larger and softer.

## The show
In wayang kulit, the puppets are moved behind a white cotton or unbleached muslin screen by a dalang, or “puppetmaster”. The dalang presides over the shadow play as its sole controlling performer who tells the story, and interprets characters and dialogue using a variety of voices. He manipulates all the puppets between a lamp and the screen to bring the puppet shadows to life. Most of the stories in the shadow plays of Java, Bali, the Malay Peninsula and mainland Southeast Asia are based on two well-known Hindu epics from India: the Mahabharata and the Ramayana.

Wayang kulit is accompanied by the music of the gamelan. While the dalang is speaking, the gamelan is silent except when it provides rattles and clanks to emphasise a statement or word. Gamelan players respond and play music intuitively to the timing and narration by the dalang. The repertoire typically consists of an overture as well as specific music for battle scenes, travelling scenes, entrances and exits of characters and the parade of warriors.

One of Singapore’s last wayang kulit dalang was Wak Taslim Harjosanajo, who died in 1985.

## Comtemporary adaptations
Shadow puppets from across the region gained new audiences as part of the ASEAN Puppetry Festival which was first held in 2006. In recent years, popular cultural references have made their way into this traditional art form. For instance, wayang kulit puppets resembling popular movie characters featured strongly at Aliwal Arts Night Crawl 2017.
