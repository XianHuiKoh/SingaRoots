# Tan Kah Kee
Tan Kah Kee (b. 21 October 1874, Jimei, Tong’an, Quanzhou, Fujian, China–d. 12 August 1961, Beijing, China) was a prominent Chinese businessman and philanthropist, nicknamed the “Henry Ford of Malaya”. He contributed extensively to the financing of schools and establishment of well-planned clusters of educational institutions, both in Singapore and China, but was better known as a Chinese nationalist who was keen in achieving China’s salvation through education and modernisation.

## Early life
Born in Jimei in Fujian province, Tan received a traditional education based on Confucian classics between the ages of eight and 16. He came to Singapore in 1890 to work for his father, Tan Kee Peck, who had a business, Chop Soon Ann (Shun’an) Rice Company.

## Career
Tan started work as an apprentice, dealing with accounts and performing secretarial duties. With his diligence and acute business sense, he did well and was soon promoted to the position of manager. Chop Soon Ann imported rice from Vietnam, Thailand and Burma, and distributed the commodity in Singapore and the Malay States. In 1892, Tan’s father branched out into pineapple plantation and cannery, and reached the peak of his economic success a few years later. However the business did not remain prosperous for long.

In 1903, when Tan returned to Singapore from his two-year stay in Jimei after handling his mother’s funeral, he was dismayed to find the losses made by Chop Soon Ann and other firms. His father was also heavily in debt due to misappropriation of funds and business mismanagement by his father’s third wife and her son. The young Tan closed his father’s businesses to repay the debts and then started his own business in pineapple plantation and cannery, armed with the experience gained during his apprenticeship. Subsequently, he not only settled his father’s debts, but also expanded his business empire to include rice mills, rubber plantations, shipping, a biscuit factory, and the manufacture of products such as tyres and shoes. He founded the Chinese newspaper Nanyang Siang Pau in 1923.

By 1925, Tan’s business enterprises had created jobs for over 30,000 people in several countries. He trained his employees, many of whom later became prominent businessmen and community leaders. The better-known ones included Lee Kong Chian and Oon Khye Hong (who later became his sons-in-laws), as well as Tan Lark Sye. In the 1920s, Tan was known as the “Henry Ford of Malaya”, as he had adopted Ford’s principle of being involved in all stages of the supply chain, except for things that could be outsourced more cheaply.

Tan’s business empire reached its peak in 1925. His business expansion, especially in rubber goods manufacturing and retailing, later weighed him down due to strong competition from cheap Japanese imports. Tan resorted to loans from banks, and by 1927 his company was running a big deficit. The Great Depression that started in 1929 made it even harder to turn his business around.

Tan’s company wound up in February 1934, but he continued to be widely respected as a community leader.

Tan was a founding member of the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce, established in 1906. His appointment as president of the clan association, Singapore Hokkien Huay Kuan, further enhanced his position as a leader of the Hokkien community in Singapore. However, he encouraged all dialect groups to unite and join forces when it came to rendering support for China, and executing community reforms such as eradicating opium addiction, improving housing and personal hygiene, and shortening the duration of funeral wakes.

Tan was a social activist during tumultuous times, aiding relief efforts such as the Fujian and Guangdong Flood Relief Fund, and was closely associated with the Tong Meng Hui or Chinese Revolutionary Alliance (predecessor of the Kuomintang) and the nationalist movement. By the time the Sino-Japanese war broke out in 1937, the Hokkien and other Chinese dialect groups were behind Tan in his leadership of fund-raising efforts for the China Relief Fund, which contributed to China’s war efforts against the Japanese invasion. In October 1938, Tan was unanimously elected as chairman of the Federation of Southseas China Relief Fund Union that represented the China Relief Funds set up across Southeast Asia. Besides raising funds, Tan also recruited volunteer drivers and mechanics to help China in the transportation of military supplies via Burma during China’s war against the Japanese.

When the Japanese invaded Singapore, Tan helped to recruit the Chinese to assist the British. After the war, the British authorities became concerned about the politicisation of the Chinese in Malaya and Singapore in general, and the organised Left groups in particular. In 1949, Tan went on a ten-month tour of China and was appointed a member of the People’s Political Consultative Conference, which met every six months to advise the Government of China. The British had considered cancelling his British citizenship so that he would not be able to re-enter Singapore. However, the cancellation could not be justified and no action was taken. Tan returned to Singapore on 15 February 1950. His tour of China not only brought him government positions but he was also pleased by the new leadership and the direction in which China was progressing. He returned to China on 21 May 1950, and renounced his British citizenship in 1957. He lived the rest of his life in Fujian.

In recognition of his contributions, Tan was given a state funeral by the Chinese government upon his death on 12 August 1961.
