# Tan Tock Seng
Tan Tock Seng (b. 1798, Malacca, Malaysia–d. 24 February 1850, Singapore) was an entrepreneur and philanthropist of Hokkien descent. Tan started out as a humble vegetable seller and rose to become one of Singapore’s most eminent philanthropists and a leader of the Chinese community. He was the first Asian to be appointed Justice of the Peace. In 1844, he helped set up a hospital for the poor that now bears his name.

## Early life
Tan was born in Malacca in 1798, the third son of an immigrant from Fujian province, China, and a local Peranakan (Straits-born Chinese) woman. In 1819, at age 21, Tan left Malacca and came to Singapore. The enterprising young man started out as a vegetable seller, bringing produce from the countryside to sell in the city. By 1827, he had saved up enough money to open a shop along the riverside at Boat Quay.

## Businessman
Through a joint business venture in land speculation with J. H. Whitehead of Shaw, Whitehead & Co., Tan became a wealthy businessman. His landed properties included 50 acres of land where the railway station at Tanjong Pagar was located, and tracts of land stretching from the Padang all the way to High Street and Tank Road. He also owned a block of shophouses at Ellenborough Building and a 14-acre fruit plantation opposite the St Andrew’s Mission Hospital.

## Philanthropist
Tan made generous contributions to charity. He was known to take care of burial expenses for destitute Chinese. His most famous philanthropic gesture was the donation of $5,000 towards the building of the Chinese Pauper Hospital (later renamed Tan Tock Seng Hospital) in 1844 at Pearl’s Hill. The building was designed by government surveyor J. T. Thomson. Although it was completed at the end of 1846, the building was operated as a hospital only from 1849 onwards, as the government had used it as a temporary convict jail. Tan also founded the Thian Hock Keng Temple at Telok Ayer Street, Singapore’s oldest temple and the centre of worship for the Hokkien community.

Tan was the first Asian to be made Justice of the Peace by then Governor William J. Butterworth. His role in helping the early Chinese immigrants settle disputes earned him the title “Captain of the Chinese”.

After a short illness, Tan died at age 52 on 24 February 1850. His original burial site was unknown, but his remains were later exhumed and interred at Outram Road. His daughter-in-law, Chua Seah Neo, and granddaughter-in-law, Wuing Neo, were also buried there. In 1969, his grave was under threat of demolition during road widening work, and his descendants intervened. After his tomb was found to be neglected in 1989, descendants of Tan Tock Seng set up a trust fund to finance the ongoing repairs and maintenance of their family graves.
