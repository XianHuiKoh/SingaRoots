# Lim Kim San
Lim Kim San (b. 30 November 1916, Singapore–d. 20 July 2006, Singapore) was a former politician best known for his contributions to public housing in the 1960s during his term as chairman of the Housing and Development Board (HDB). Throughout his political career, Lim held various ministerial portfolios including finance, education, defence, communications and the environment. He also chaired the Council of Presidential Advisers as well as boards of various organisations such as the Port of Singapore Authority (PSA), Singapore Press Holdings (SPH) and Monetary Authority of Singapore.

## Early life
The eldest in a family of six children, Lim’s early education began at Oldham Hall School and later Anglo-Chinese School in Singapore. From a very young age, he began discussing with his father about the latter’s businesses, which included gasoline, salt, rubber and sago. In 1939, Lim graduated with an arts diploma in economics from Raffles College.

## Career
After the Japanese Occupation (1942–45), Lim took over the operations of a sago business in Geylang in which his father-in-law had a stake. Lim subsequently invented a way to mechanise sago pearl production and became a self-made millionaire businessman. Besides his sago factory, he was also involved in banking, heading the United Chinese Bank, Batu Pahat Bank and Pacific Bank in the 1950s.

Lim was appointed as a member of the Public Service Commission in 1959 and became the first chairman of HDB the following year. He entered into politics in 1963 when he contested the general election in Cairnhill that year as a People’s Action Party (PAP) candidate and was successfully elected as a member of parliament. Between 1963 and 1980, Lim held several ministerial portfolios including national development, finance, defence, education, environment and communications.

## Accomplishments
During his term as HDB’s chairman from 1960 to 1963, Lim spearheaded the construction of low-cost public housing to tackle the housing shortage at the time. In slightly over three years, HDB managed to complete 26,000 flats. For his achievements, he was accorded the state’s highest honour, Darjah Utama Temasek (Order of the Temasek) in 1962, as well as the Philippines’ Ramon Magsaysay Award in 1965 for community leadership.

As chairman of PSA (1979–94), Lim led the transformation of PSA from a regional entrepot into the world’s number-one container port by 1990. He implemented a series of changes such as the introduction of new systems and a revision of work processes and attitudes. A third container terminal, Brani Terminal, was officially opened in 1993.

Lim retired from politics in 1981 but continued to help the PAP in its selection of suitable candidates to contest elections. In 1990, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal for his contributions to the party.

He then assumed the role of executive chairman of SPH on 1 September 1988. During his 14 years with SPH as executive chairman and three years as its senior adviser, SPH grew to become one of the region’s leading media companies, with an increase in net profit from S$73.7 million in 1988 to S$490 million in 2005.

In 2000, the National University of Singapore launched the Lim Kim San Professorship in Business Policy in his honour.
