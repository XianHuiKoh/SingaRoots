# Liu Kang
Liu Kang (b. 1 April 1911, Yongchun, Fujian, China–d. 1 June 2004, Singapore), also known as Liu Kai, was a pioneer oil painter who was key in establishing a local style in Singapore’s visual arts. As a renowned artist, Liu Kang not only produced a wide portfolio of works but also, through his various positions in art schools, influenced the next generation of artists and painters in Singapore.

## Early life
Born in the year the Chinese Qing dynasty fell, Liu spent his early years in Malaya, where his father worked as a rubber merchant. A mispronunciation by his principal at Muar Primary School led to his name being changed from Liu Kai to Liu Kang. He continued his secondary school education in China’s Jinan University Middle School in 1926. During the school holidays, he took art classes at the Shanghai College of Fine Arts (later known as the Xinhua Art Academy). While he was residing with his good friend, the painter Chen Jen Hao, Liu became acquainted and fell in love with Jen Hao’s sister, Chen Jen Pen (also spelt Chen Jen Ping), who later became his wife.

Shanghai was strongly influenced by Western arts during the 1920s, the time Liu was studying art there. Liu continued his art education in Paris, France, at the Académie de la Grande Chaumière from 1929 to 1933. There he was drawn to postimpressionists such as Paul Cézanne, Paul Gaugin and Vincent Van Gogh, masters whose works influenced his own.

## World War II
Liu moved to Muar when the Japanese invaded China in 1937 and then later came to Singapore. When Japan invaded Singapore in 1942, Liu and his family fled back to Muar, leaving behind more than 200 paintings. However, all the paintings had disappeared when he returned after the war. Liu witnessed many war atrocities committed by the Japanese soldiers. In 1946, after the war had ended, he published sketches of Japanese brutality on Asians in a multivolume work entitled Chop Suey. The series was published in both English and Chinese, and in 1991 was translated into Japanese. Only limited copies of the original Chop Suey can be found as a complete set.

## Nanyang style
Having received his art education from the best of both hemispheres, Liu translated these influences and incorporated local Southeast Asian flavours into his work to create the distinct Nanyang style. This style, attributed to Singapore’s pioneer painters, was first seen in the works of Liu and fellow painters Chen Wen Hsi, Chen Chong Swee and Cheong Soo Pieng upon their return from a study-cum-painting trip in Bali in 1952. Some of his well-known paintings from this era include: “Artist and Model” (1954), “Batik Workers” (1954) and “Balinese Girl in Red Sarong” (undated).

Besides his works, Liu continued to influence the next generation of artists through his leadership in the Association of Chinese Artists of Singapore and the Singapore Art Society. In addition to renowned artists, some of his students include personalities such as Singapore’s first elected president, Ong Teng Cheong.

Despite eye problems and a failed cataract transplant in 1986, Liu Kang continued to paint and exhibit his works. His most significant exhibition prior to his death was held in China in November 2000, after having postponed it for more than a decade due to the Tiananmen incident in 1989. Liu’s works have been exhibited in Singapore and overseas including France, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan and the United States.
