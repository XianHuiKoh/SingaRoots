# Goh Keng Swee
Goh Keng Swee (Dr) (b. 6 October 1918, Malacca–d. 14 May 2010, Singapore) has often been called the “economic architect” of Singapore for his great contributions to the development of Singapore into a prosperous nation during his terms as minister for finance and defence. He held several other key appointments, including deputy prime minister, minister for education as well as chairman of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and various government-led companies.

## Early life
Born into a middle-income Peranakan family in Malacca, Goh came to Singapore when he was two years old. He received his early education at Anglo-Chinese School (1927–36) and went on to Raffles College (1936–39).

Graduating with a diploma in arts, he entered the colonial civil service in 1939, but his career was interrupted by the Japanese Occupation (1942–45). Goh rejoined the civil service in 1946 and his outstanding performance earned him a scholarship to study statistics at the London School of Economics (LSE) in 1948. During his stay in London, Goh started the Malayan Forum, an anticolonial student group, and became its first chairman.

In 1951, Goh graduated from LSE with first-class honours in economics and won the William Farr Prize. He resumed work in the civil service back in Singapore that year, but returned to LSE for further studies in 1954 and obtained his Doctor of Philosophy degree in 1956.

## Career
Goh returned to work at the Social Welfare Department as an assistant director. He was promoted to the position of director shortly after, and remained in this job until March 1958. During his time in the colonial civil service, he formed the Council for Joint Action together with K. M. Byrne in 1952 to seek equal pay for local civil servants.

In August 1958, he resigned from the civil service and prepared to contest the 1959 general elections as a People’s Action Party (PAP) candidate. He won the Kreta Ayer seat and represented the constituency in the legislative assembly, and later the parliament of Singapore, until his retirement from politics in 1984.

## Major achievements
Appointed the minister for finance in 1959, Goh introduced an industrialisation programme with the aim of creating jobs for Singaporeans. Jurong, then a swampy wasteland, was transformed into Singapore’s first industrial estate. To jumpstart the area’s development, he offered tax incentives and drew in foreign investments. He also initiated the setting up of the Economic Development Board (EDB), which was established in August 1961 with the purpose of furthering the economic development of Singapore by attracting foreign investments.

When Singapore separated from Malaysia and attained independence on 9 August 1965, Goh became the nation’s first defence minister and his most pressing task was to build up a strong local defence force. To quickly form the Singapore Armed Forces, he implemented compulsory national service for all male Singaporeans aged 18 and above.

During Goh’s term as minister for education, the importance of curriculum development in the education system prompted him to set up the Curriculum Development Institute in 1980. To tackle the high dropout rates, he introduced the streaming system in 1979 to allow students to learn at their own pace and within their own capabilities. He also introduced religious education, but this was later removed from the school curriculum.

When he was appointed the chairman of MAS and the Board of Commissioners of Currency in 1980, he took measures to promote Singapore as an international financial centre. To this end, amendments were made in 1984 to three major financial regulations: the Banking Act, Monetary Authority of Singapore Act and the Finance Companies Act. During the 1985 recession, he acted swiftly to stop the slide of the Singapore dollar.

In the early years of China’s economic reform programme, the Chinese central government sought Goh’s expertise and appointed him as its economic adviser on coastal development and tourism in 1985. He was the first foreigner to be appointed to such a role.

In 1985, the Singapore government awarded him the Order of Temasek (First Class) for his contributions to the nation’s development. To honour him, some banks in Singapore set up the Goh Keng Swee Scholarship Fund in 1992, while the National University of Singapore established the Goh Keng Swee Professorship and Master’s Scholarship in Economics in 1996. To preserve his legacy, Goh’s wife Phua Swee Liang set up the Goh Keng Swee Foundation in 2008 to help the disadvantaged.
