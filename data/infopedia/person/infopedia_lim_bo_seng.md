# Lim Bo Seng
Lim Bo Seng (Major-General) (b. 27 April 1909, Nan’an, Fujian, China–d. 29 June 1944, Batu Gajah, Perak, Malaya) was a prominent Hokkien businessman who undertook active leadership in anti-Japanese activities during World War II. He is recognised as a local war hero in Singapore.

## Early life
Lim was the 11th child and the first son of Lim Chee Gee (also known as Lim Loh and Lim Hong Leong). Lim came to Singapore from China at the age of 16 and studied at Raffles Institution. He later enrolled in the University of Hong Kong, but discontinued his education there in 1929 when his father passed away. Lim returned to Singapore to take over his father’s businesses, which included biscuit and brick manufacturing. In 1931, he married Gan Choo Neo, a Straits-born Chinese, with whom he had seven children.

## Role during World War II
In the 1930s, Lim, under the alias Tan Choon Lim, participated in anti-Japanese activities in Singapore, particularly in supporting the China Relief Fund. Upon the request of the then governor of Singapore, Shenton Thomas, Lim formed the Chinese Liaison Committee to assist in civil defence. After the fall of Kota Bharu in northern Malaya in December 1941, Lim, as head of Labour Services of the Overseas Chinese Mobilisation Council, organised more than 10,000 men for the British government to man essential services and to construct defences around the island. As Japanese troops began to approach Singapore from Johor, Lim and his team helped to blow up the Causeway to impede the Japanese advance.

Before Singapore fell to the Japanese, Lim escaped to India where he was joined by the British resistance group Force 136, and was trained by the British for intelligence work. Formed by the British and Chinese governments in June 1942, Force 136 supported resistance groups and coordinated guerrilla operations. In 1943, Lim went to China to recruit men for Force 136. With a group of Force 136 members, he landed in Japanese-occupied Malaya by submarine later that year, and set up an intelligence network in the urban areas of Pangkor, Lumut, Tapah and Ipoh. The intelligence network, known as Operation Zipper, was aimed at recapturing Malaya with British support by 1945.

While in Ipoh, Lim’s whereabouts and espionage involvement were betrayed to the Japanese. On 27 March 1944, he was caught by the Japanese while fleeing. Lim died in Batu Gajah Jail, Perak, on 29 June 1944. After the war, Lim’s remains were disinterred from the jail in December 1945 and reburied in Singapore on 13 January 1946, on a hill overlooking MacRitchie Reservoir. In February 1946, the Chinese Nationalist government posthumously awarded him the rank of major-general.

## Lim Bo Seng Memorial
In 1946, the Lim Bo Seng Memorial Committee, which included representatives from the Chinese Nationalist government, was established to raise funds for the construction of a public memorial dedicated to Lim. The colonial government rejected the committee’s proposal to build a memorial park around his grave, but granted permission for a memorial to be built at the Esplanade. The British Commissioner-General for Southeast Asia at the time, Malcolm MacDonald, laid the foundation stone for the structure on 3 November 1953. The completed memorial was unveiled on 29 June 1954 by Charles Loewen, then commander-in-chief of the Far East Land Forces.

Designed by Ng Keng Siang, the memorial occupies a site measuring 30 m by 24 m, which was donated by the government. The construction cost of $50,000 was funded by donations from the Chinese community. The memorial takes the form of a 3.6-metre-high octagonal pagoda made of bronze, concrete and marble. A bronze three-tier roof caps the pagoda, while four bronze lions stand guard at the base. Four bronze plaques placed around the pagoda give an account of Lim’s life in English, Chinese, Tamil and Jawi (Malay). On 28 December 2010, the Lim Bo Seng Memorial was gazetted as a national monument.
