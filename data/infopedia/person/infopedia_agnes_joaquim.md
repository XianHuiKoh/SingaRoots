# Agnes Joaquim
Agnes Joaquim (Ashkhen Hovakimian) (b. 7 April 1854, Singapore–d. 2 July 1899, Singapore), a second-generation Singapore resident of Persian Armenian descent, is best known for successfully cross-breeding Vanda teres with Vanda hookeriana to create a new orchid known as Vanda Miss Joaquim (Papilionanthe Miss Joaquim). The orchid hybrid was named Singapore’s national flower in 1981. In 2015, the Singapore Council of Women’s Organisations inducted into its Singapore Women’s Hall of Fame. The award cited her as the first woman in the world to breed a hybrid orchid.

## Horticultural legacy - Vanda Miss Joaquim
Like her mother, Urelia Zachariah, Joaquim was an avid gardener and horticulturalist who won numerous prizes at flower shows for cultivating various flowers, ferns, spices, fruits and vegetables. She successfully bred an orchid in the gardens of her family home around 1890. The record of the orchid, later named Vanda Miss Joaquim after its breeder, was first published in June 1893 in the horticultural journal, The Gardeners’ Chronicle. Vanda Miss Joaquim made its maiden public appearance in Singapore at the annual Flower Show in April 1899, and won Joaquim the first prize for rarest orchid.

Spearheading the development of Singapore’s cut-flower industry, Vanda Miss Joaquim became a major commercial success. The orchid was designated Singapore’s national flower in 1981.

### Controversy
There was a controversy about whether the Vanda Miss Joaquim was a product of nature or an artificial hybrid bred by Joaquim. In September 2016, the National Parks Board and the National Heritage Board amended their accounts of the discovery of the flower to credit Joaquim as the breeder of the national flower.

## Other interests
Besides her horticultural skills and interests, Joaquim was also an active member of the Armenian Church and a skilled embroiderer.

## Death
Joaquim died of cancer on 2 July 1899, at the age of 45, about three months after she received the prize for Vanda Miss Joaquim at the Flower Show. Her tombstone can be found within the grounds of the Armenian Church on Hill Street. It was originally located at the Bukit Timah cemetery. Her headstone bears the inscription, “Let her own works praise her”.

## Family
Joaquim was the eldest daughter and second child out of 11 children of Parsick Joaquim, an Armenian merchant and commercial agent. The family used to live at 30 Hill Street, but by 1861 had moved to Mount Narcis, the name of the family mansion that sat on Parsick Hill off Tanjong Pagar.

### Father
Basil (Barsigh or Parsick) Joaquim (d. 17 May 1872, Singapore) was a merchant and commercial agent in the 1840s. He married Urelia on 17 February 1852. Believed to have originated from Madras, Parsick’s work as a commercial agent often took him to Calcutta, Batavia and Penang. A notable philanthropist, he acquired considerable property and investments, which enabled his family to tide over after his sudden death in 1872.

### Mother
Urelia (Urughlu) Zachariah (b. 1828, Singapore–d. 29 April 1905) was a gardening enthusiast who won awards at annual flower shows during the 1880s and 1890s.

## Variant names
Armenian names are anglicised in various ways. The name Joaquim is sometimes spelt Hovakimian or Joakim, while Agnes might be spelt Ashkhen or Ashghen.

The Anglicised surname Joaquim is pronounced with a “j” sound, as in “jo”.
