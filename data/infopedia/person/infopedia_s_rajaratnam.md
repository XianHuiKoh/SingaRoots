# S. Rajaratnam
Sinnathamby Rajaratnam (b. 25 February 1915, Jaffna, Sri Lanka–d. 22 February 2006, Singapore), better known as S. Rajaratnam, was a former journalist, co-founder of the People's Action Party (PAP), first minister for foreign affairs in post-independence Singapore, a member of parliament for the Kampong Glam constituency and former minister for labour and culture. He was the second deputy prime minister in 1980 until he stepped down in 1985 and became a senior minister. Rajaratnam was one of the pioneer leaders who helped to shape Singapore’s development.

## Early life
Born in Jaffna, Sri Lanka, Rajaratnam was only six months old when he was brought back to Seremban in then Malaya, where his father worked as a supervisor at a rubber plantation. He began his early education at St Paul's Institution in Seremban. It was at this stage that he became an avid reader, with the greatest influence from his uncles who bought him many books. He went on to study at Victoria Institution, Kuala Lumpur, and finally Raffles Institution, Singapore. In 1935, he went to King's College London to study law. However, his studies were disrupted by World War II. During his time in London, Rajaratnam became involved in politics as a member of the Left Book Club, which organised meetings, rallies and book readings across the country. It was during his time at King’s College and these intellectual circles that Rajaratnam appreciated the importance of political education and debate.

Rajaratnam worked as a journalist to support himself when financial aid from his father was terminated during World War II (1942–45). He married a Hungarian in 1943 and stayed in London for several years. They returned to Malaya in 1947 after the war. Rajaratnam worked as a journalist at The Malaya Tribune from 1948 to 1950 and left to join another newspaper, Singapore Standard, as an associate editor in 1950. Between 1954 and 1959, he was an editorial staff at The Straits Times in Singapore.

As a journalist, he wrote articles related to the political issues in Singapore and Malaya. His open anti-British and anti-communist stance attracted the attention of Lee Kuan Yew, Toh Chin Chye and Goh Keng Swee, who, together with Rajaratnam, formed the People’s Action Party in 1954.

## Political career
In 1959, he resigned from The Straits Times to contest in the Legislative Assembly general election. He was elected as an assemblyman for the Kampong Glam constituency and also appointed as the minister for culture – a position in which he served till 1963. With the formation of the Federation of Malaysia on 16 September 1963, he became a member of the Federal Malaysian Parliament.

When Singapore gained independence, he was the first minister for foreign affairs. He held this office until 1980, with additional duty as the minister for labour in 1968. As a long-serving foreign affairs minister, he contributed immensely to establishing good relations with nations of the world, which was of paramount importance to a young, struggling nation, especially after the separation from Malaysia. He represented Singapore in the Bangkok Declaration in 1967, which was convened to establish the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). In December 1997, together with the other founding members, Rajaratnam was honoured with an award by ASEAN for this significant contribution.

One of his enduring legacies in Singapore is the National Pledge. Largely drafted by Rajaratnam in 1966, the pledge played a significant role in promoting national loyalty and identity following Singapore's separation from Malaysia. The pledge articulated his ideal of multi-racialism and the vision of one united people in Singapore.

In 1980, he was appointed as the second deputy prime minister. He relinquished this post in 1985 to make way for younger candidates, but remained as a senior minister in the Prime Minister's Office till his retirement from politics in 1988. After his retirement, he served as a senior distinguished fellow at the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies (now ISEAS-Yusof IshakInstitute) from 1988.

Rajaratnam died from heart failure on 22 February 2006 at his home on Chancery Lane. A state funeral was held for him on 25 February 2006. Ministers, diplomats, community leaders and students were amont the 1,500 mourners who paid their final respects.

## Legacy
In recognition of contributions to Singapore’s development, the S. Rajaratnam Scholarship (renamed S. Rajaratnam Professorship in Strategic Studies in 1999) was set up in 1990. In 2006, Raffles Institution named a new building in the school after him. The S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies was established in 2007 in honour of his contributions as foreign minister. Launched in October 2014, the S$100-million S. Rajaratnam Endowment established by Temasek Holdings supports programmes that foster stronger ties in the region and internationally, as well as initiatives that “recognise the work and contributions of Mr Rajaratnam”.
