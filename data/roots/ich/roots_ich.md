# Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH)
The National Heritage Board (NHB) has launched an inventory which seeks to identify and document the diverse forms of living heritage that are present and practised in multicultural Singapore.

The establishment of such an inventory is a major step for the safeguarding of Singapore’s living heritage, and will contribute towards nominating an intangible cultural heritage element onto the UNESCO Representative List of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.

Intangible cultural heritage (ICH) comprises the traditions, rituals, crafts, expressions, knowledge and skills that we practise and pass on from generation to generation. As it is part of our living, everyday heritage, our intangible cultural heritage is dynamic, evolving and constantly being updated and/or re-created by individuals, groups and communities in response to their environments, interactions with nature and history, and changes in our lifestyles.

Through the inventory, we hope to document and make available more information on Singapore’s living heritage, and to promote greater public awareness and appreciation of our diverse cultures, traditions and practices.

The inventory will be a growing inventory where we will continue to work with communities to identify and document living traditions, and add more intangible cultural heritage elements over time.

As of March 2024, the Inventory consists of research on 106 elements, and more will be added progressively. 

## Categories of Singapore's ICH
The six categories of Singapore’s Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH) are:
1. Social Practices, Rituals & Festive Events
2. Oral Traditions & Expressions
3. Performing Arts
4. Knowledge & Practices Concerning Nature & the Universe
5. Traditional Craftsmanship
6. Food Heritage

### Social Practices, Rituals & Festive Events
Social practices, rituals and festive events are actively practiced by people of different ethnicities and religions in Singapore throughout the year. The diversity of practices and festivals in Singapore, which are rooted in the cultures and traditions of the people, are a reflection of the multicultural communities that make up the Singapore society.

In Singapore, the most common forms of social practices, rituals and festive events revolve around the various festivals celebrated by Singapore’s different ethnic communities. These festivals include Hari Raya Puasa (Malay community), Lunar New Year (Chinese community) and Deepavali (Indian community).

While each festive celebration has its own unique customs and practices, there are often similarities found between these festivals. These similarities include the purchase of new clothes, the preparation of festive food and snacks using family recipes, as well as the conferring of well wishes for the year to come.

### Oral Traditions & Expressions
Oral traditions and expressions in Singapore are practiced and transmitted between generations through many different languages and dialects. Aside from the four official languages of Malay, English, Mandarin and Tamil, Singapore’s linguistic diversity includes a variety of other languages and ethnic dialects.

These languages and dialects include Hokkien and Cantonese (Chinese dialects), Javanese (a language from the island of Java spoken by parts of the Malay community in Singapore) and Kristang (a creole language spoken by parts of the Eurasian community, which comprises people of a mix of European and Asian heritage).

The practices of oral traditions and expressions come in many forms. They include theatre-type performances such as getai (歌台) and wayang peranakan, along with song and music traditions like dikir barat, a Malay choral ensemble. Through these channels, oral traditions and expressions are transmitted, and they enable communities to nurture and create their own cultures and identities. 

### Performing Arts
Performing arts in Singapore take the form of various artistic practices such as music, dance and theatre. They provide an avenue for bearers and practitioners to explore their roots, and achieve a deeper sense of connection with their communities.

Today, there are over 100 active performing arts group in Singapore that organise more than 1,400 traditional arts activities and performances annually. These practices include traditional Malay music, Indian dance forms such as kathakali and Chinese opera.

### Knowledge & Practices Concerning Nature & the Universe
In Singapore, knowledge and practices concerning nature and the universe are most commonly associated with the cultural traditions and practices surrounding birth, health and death.

While the Chinese, Malay and Indian communities have their own traditional pre-natal and post-natal practices, it is common to see some of these practices, such as jamu (a herbal medicine used by the Malay community), being used by women across communities as part of post-natal care. 

ICH practices pertaining to health are also actively practiced by the abovementioned communities and these practices include traditional Chinese medicine (or TCM), traditional Malay medicine and Ayurveda (a form of traditional Indian medicine).

### Traditional Craftsmanship
Traditional craftsmanship in Singapore consists of a wide selection of trades carried out by practitioners, who have been honing and transmitting their skills across generations. Examples of traditional crafts in Singapore include the making of traditional clothing wear like the sari or baju kurong, handicrafts like Nyonya beadwork and embroidery, and Chinese musical instruments.

To keep pace with emerging trends and globalisation, some traditional craftsmen in Singapore have been reinventing their crafts and exploring ways to appeal to a new generation of customers, while retaining the foundations of their respective practices. 

An example will be the modernising of traditional women’s clothing like the cheongsam (a form-fitting dress with a cylindrical collar worn mainly by the Chinese), sari (a garment of cotton or silk draped around the body worn mainly by women from South Asia) and kebaya (a light loose tunic worn mainly by the Malays and Peranakans) into fashionable wear that appeals to the younger generation and changing tastes. By doing so, practitioners of traditional crafts are able to keep their trade alive and ensure the continued transmission of their traditional crafts.

### Food Heritage
For many Singaporeans, food heritage is the form of ICH that they can most readily appreciate and identify with. Singapore’s food heritage connects people of different backgrounds and ethnicities, and represents the diverse cultures and rich traditions of Singapore’s forefathers.

Singaporeans enjoy a wide array of cuisines that include Eurasian, Peranakan, Indian, Malay, Chinese, and many other international dishes. Across generations, practitioners and bearers of food heritage have constantly adapted their recipes to include ingredients and cooking techniques of other communities, allowing Singaporeans to enjoy a multitude of cross-cultural flavours.

In a 2017 public poll, ‘Food Heritage’ came up top, as the most important aspect of Singapore’s ICH amongst more than 3,000 respondents. Following public consultations and suggestions from the community, Singapore has included ‘Food Heritage’ as an additional category in its ICH Inventory in 2018.
